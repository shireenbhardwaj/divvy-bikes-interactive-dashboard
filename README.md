# Divvy Bikes Usage Dashboard
## Overview

This interactive dashboard provides a detailed overview of Divvy bike rides, offering insights into key performance metrics over three distinct timeframes: weekly, monthly, and yearly. The dashboard helps users track Divvy's bike-sharing performance, focusing on ride patterns, member and casual rider behavior, and other variables such as weather and park events. It provides decision-makers with valuable data to optimize services, improve user experience, and plan for future growth.

The dashboard is built in Power BI and offers easy navigation for users to explore data for different time periods: **Last Week**, **Monthly Overview**, and **Yearly Performance**. Each time period view has the same set of visuals but focuses on the respective timeframe, allowing users to analyze trends and performance across days, weeks, months, and even years.

## Features & Visual Walkthrough

The dashboard contains several key visuals to provide insights into Divvy bike usage data:
- **Weather and Park Event Indicators:** This section indicates whether the current day is a sports day and if a park event is happening. These factors can influence bike usage patterns, making them important to track.
- **Date Selector:** Displays the current date and the timeframe being analyzed (Last Week, Monthly, or Yearly). Users can switch between these views to track bike usage over different periods.
- **Ride Data vs. Target Performance:** This visual shows whether the total rides for the selected period meet or exceed the target performance. The progress bar is updated dynamically, giving users a clear indication of performance.
- **Daily Divvy Rides Trend:** This line chart visualizes daily ride trends. It tracks the total number of rides for each day of the week. The chart allows users to see which days had the highest or lowest number of rides, providing insights into patterns and helping with operational planning. This is available for weekly, monthly, and yearly views.
- **Total Rides:** Displays the total number of rides for the chosen timeframe. The metric also includes a percentage change compared to the previous week, month, or year.
- **Weekend vs. Weekday Performance:** This bar chart compares ride usage between weekends and weekdays. It highlights whether there is a significant difference in the number of rides on weekends compared to weekdays, providing insights into user behavior. This comparison is available for weekly, monthly, and yearly data views.
- **Performance Variability on Sports and Non-Sports Days:** A bar chart comparing the performance on sports days vs. non-sports days. This is particularly useful for understanding how external events (like sports events) impact bike usage. Available in weekly, monthly, and yearly views.
- **Member vs. Casual Riders:** This scatter plot shows the frequency of rides taken by member riders vs. casual riders. It tracks the number of rides for each day and categorizes them as either member or casual rides. This visual is available for weekly, monthly, and yearly views.

This gives insights into the behavior of casual riders compared to members, which is important for identifying user engagement trends. This plot is available in weekly, monthly, and yearly views.

## How to Navigate the Dashboard

- **Interpret the Data:**
    - Review the Total Rides figure to assess performance for the selected period.
    - Compare Weekend vs Weekday Performance to understand ride patterns based on the day of the week.
    - Analyze the Member vs. Casual Riders chart to discern usage trends between different types of riders.
    - Use the Performance Variability chart to assess how events like sports games impact bike usage on different days.

## Data Analysis and Key Insights
